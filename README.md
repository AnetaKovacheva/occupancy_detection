This Notebook explores the **Occupancy Detection Data Set** and builds upon the excellent work of Omer Turksoy, published in Kaggle ([HVAC Occupancy Detection with ML and DL Methods](https://www.kaggle.com/turksoyomer/hvac-occupancy-detection-with-ml-and-dl-methods)).

Occupancy data comes into three parts: `dataset.txt`, `dataset2.txt`, and `datatraining.txt`. The latter should be used for model training, and the others - for model validation and testing, respectively. Ground-truth occupancy was obtained from time stamped pictures taken every minute. Datasets hold information about room properties, e.g., temperature, humidity, CO2, etc. Predictions could be used by companies and property managers to plan Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC). 

Initially, I planned only to explore the data and the modelling approach. It turned out however, that the provided datasets are mismatched. Hence, I improved train-validation-test split, which resulted in slightly better model performance. Furthermore, I wrapped almost all computations and transformations in functions to avoid redundant scripts.
